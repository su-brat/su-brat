### Namaste 🙏

I'm **Subrat Kumar Pattanaik**. I am a Computer Science graduate 🎓 who loves (please imagine a hand with index finger and thumb crossed emoji here) to spend part 🌗 of his time ⌚ building logic 💡 for various problems 💥 and explaining (coding 👨‍💻) them to his digital friends (a.k.a. computers 💻). I love some other cool stuffs as well, like paneer rolls, garlic bread 🍞 (prefer toasty a bit more you know), bike riding 🏍 (a bit more without moving traffic 🚦 though), experiencing digital entertainment 🎞 (more vividly listening to music 🎧) and sometimes wondering 💭 about how technology can bliss our lives (precisely, my life) 😋. So do follow me on github but be you. Gracias!
